      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">S</span>ubsequent to the effects of the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Geostationary_orbit_animation.gif">rotational principle,</a> I found myself at a place and time at which the
        setting of the sun and the rising of the moon could be seen. In this moment and at this position I reflected on the concerns of the world. The white <a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7c/Pollution_in_Margarita_Island.jpg/1024px-Pollution_in_Margarita_Island.jpg">miasma</a> which rose from the land hung in the air, causing those who walked in its midst to cough
        and choke. In the sky hung <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Origins.gif/640px-Origins.gif">red clouds</a> drenched in blood which cast dark shadows upon those who labored in the fields despite the late hour.
        Against the receding horizon stood many great black plumes, either from pit fires or from workshops. The <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/Recommended_Levels_of_Blue_Light_Exposure_By_Age.png">silver light of the
          moon</a> struck the faces of those retiring to their bedchambers, some tired by the silver light and others tired by the stress of obligating those in the fields to commit to their work, and they held shut their windows as the sun was
        consumed by the horizon. As I considered these things, I felt a heaviness in my body, and although the lights of my own chamber had been lit, I retreated from the lancet window to my own bed.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">H</span>ere the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5d/Liquid_Crystal_Display_Macro_Example_zoom_2.jpg">light of the day and the shadows of the night met</a> upon the ceiling and created
        many interesting patterns. As my eyes rested upon these shadows, through which I could see many patterns caused by that which projected them, I began to think of pearlescence and its beauty. <a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Iridescence_foil.jpg/442px-Iridescence_foil.jpg">In these precious shadows</a> many things began to form, and although the earthly portion of my being was heavy, the portion
        corresponding to airy qualities lifted towards these shapes and pearlescent shadows.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">F</span>reed from my earthly being and nourished by shapes caused by light and its absence, that which was earthly I could see through this pearlescent material, as though they were shadows caused by a yet unseen
        source. I felt myself conveyed a great distance through this iridescent haze, during which <a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/ce/Planetary_Domiciles_in_Tetrabiblos.png/1024px-Planetary_Domiciles_in_Tetrabiblos.png">I saw the twelve signs of the night sky</a>, and that which those signs ruled over, and
        that which ruled over them. I saw shadows of the ram, the bull, the twins, the crab, the lion, the virgin, the scales, the scorpion, the hunter, the sea-goat, the water-bearer, and the fish. Yet these shadows were not wholly these things, for
        simultaneously cast within these shadows were yet other shapes, which danced with great skill and flourish as if they were entertainment for monarchs.</p>
      <br>
      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">W</span>ithin these deeper shadows I saw figures, which appeared in shape to be figures of earthly beings, yet within their essence was an airy or cloudy quality. I saw these figures organize themselves thusly:
        first, under <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Swissbit_2GB_PC2-5300U-555.jpg/1024px-Swissbit_2GB_PC2-5300U-555.jpg">the sign of the ram</a>, they created the world. Under <a

        motion. Under <a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/A_cross-section_of_a_pregnant_uterus_containing_twins._Engra_Wellcome_V0014950.jpg/534px-A_cross-section_of_a_pregnant_uterus_containing_twins._Engra_Wellcome_V0014950.jpg">the
          sign of the twins</a>, they mixed precious objects together. These objects were of an earthly quality, but these figures commanded these precious things to obey their desires.</p>

      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>nder <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Wakkanai_20140723_151953.jpg/1024px-Wakkanai_20140723_151953.jpg">the sign of the crab</a>, these figures took their precious
        objects and created the earthly world by spinning threads made of copper, silver, and gold. Under <a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9e/Lion_%28Panthera_leo%29_male_6y.jpg/640px-Lion_%28Panthera_leo%29_male_6y.jpg">the sign of the lion</a>, they created great houses within which they stored a harvest of
        knowledge gleaned from the world below. Under <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Virgin_Utah.JPG/1024px-Virgin_Utah.JPG">the sign of the virgin</a>, those that filled the great storehouses, which was
        accomplished by many spirits, informed these figures of that which occurred outside of the great walls of this celestial garden. </p>

          sign of the scales</a>, that which was housed in the great storehouses was judged by a terrifying Scribe having two faces that these figures served and assisted. Under <a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Venom_Squirting_in_Scorpions.svg/1083px-Venom_Squirting_in_Scorpions.svg.png">the sign of the scorpion</a>, a great host of earthly figures pleaded and waited for access
        through the great walls of this space. Under <a

          sign of the hunter</a>, I saw the figures of earthly form but airy quality commit themselves to a great and mysterious ritual, through which their essence fully left their earthly forms and joined in consort with the terrifying scribe.</p>
      <br>

      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">U</span>nder <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/99/Goats_on_Lundy_%2810%29.jpg/1024px-Goats_on_Lundy_%2810%29.jpg">the sign of the sea-goat</a>, I saw promises of the mysterious and
        terrifying ritual that had occurred, which fully separated the earthly from the airy. Under <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Water-bearer_%2831111583437%29.jpg/1024px-Water-bearer_%2831111583437%29.jpg">the sign of the water-bearer</a>, I saw a figure not unlike my own meditate upon the shadows shown to me. At the end of my travel through this iridescent
        haze, I saw under <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/83/Fish_sign_in_Lunenburg%2C_Nova_Scotia_%282012%29.jpg/1280px-Fish_sign_in_Lunenburg%2C_Nova_Scotia_%282012%29.jpg">the sign of the fish</a> a great desolation. This desolation was as empty and formless as the beginning of a dream, and I saw the concepts behind forms evaporate as if they were frost in the morning of the vernal equinox.</p>

      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>fter all this, as the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Morton_heilig_patent_fig2.png">entire field of my perception</a> was brought back within me, I could see a refinement of
        shape and form. These strange figures moving about in the shadows were earthly only in the tracing of their shape, for in their essence they belonged to the clouds and <a
          href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Earth_within_celestial_sphere.gif">other higher celestial spheres</a>. Before them laid a demonstration of the world they desired, and this desire was held against those whose
        quality of being was different. They studied this demonstration and used a great contrivance to produce a model of their desired world, referencing their idealized demonstration of the ways in which thoughts and ideas should be organized, and
        paid no attention to me or my being.</p>

      <hr>
      <br>
      <p><span class="padded-dropcap">A</span>s these things came to pass, I noticed within myself my own quality, which had been transformed from a fixed quality into a mutable quality by <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/77/Camera_Obscura%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_LCCN2013630743.tif/lossy-page1-1280px-Camera_Obscura%2C_San_Francisco%2C_California_LCCN2013630743.tif.jpg">the projection of the pearlescent shadows</a> I had witnessed.
